# Struggles

- It's difficult.

```js 
import styles from './styles.module.css';

<div className={styles.button}>Click me</div>
```
E.g: We might know how to use CSS Modules, but we might not need to know how CSS Modules work under the hood

<v-click>
```js
require('postcss-modules')({
  getJSON: (cssFileName, json, outputFileName) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(json));
  },
  generateScopedName: function (name, filename, css) {
    const stringHash = require('string-hash');
    const i = css.indexOf('.' + name);
    const line = css.substr(0, i).split(/[\\r\\n|\\n|\\r]/).length;
    const removedNewLineCharactersCss = css.replace(/(\\r\\n|\\n|\\r)/g, '');
    const hash = stringHash(removedNewLineCharactersCss).toString(36).substr(0, 5);
    return '_' + name + '_' + hash + '_' + line;
  },
})
```
</v-click>

How to do that?

# Some tips to start your OSS journey


---

# How to choose an open source project to work on?

- Should be projects you use every day
<Tweet id="1543771988333715456" scale="0.65" />

- Should solve your own problem


---

# Find a maintainer

- Building an OS project is hard and stressful. 
- It would be easier to have someone to discuss technical and motivate you to continue the project. 

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVxLXjtUYAESaYE?format=jpg&name=medium"  width="500"/>


---

# Do not start at 1.x

- A new project is full of PoC and experiments
- 1.x means your software must be backward compatible
- Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.

<img src="/glass-broken.jpg" width="400" />


---

# Use your own software

- When you use it as a normal user, you know if you need to adjust or add more features to make it usable

<img src="/use-own-software.jpg" width="400" />


---

# Ask for feedback

- Your software can be subjective

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVxLZAkUsAAlP9L?format=jpg&name=medium" width="500"/>


---

# Learn from others

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVxLZjfUcAAcByv?format=jpg&name=900x900)

<!--
Do not reinvent the wheel. There is much good software out there already solved your problems. Learn from them, read their source code to see how they do.
